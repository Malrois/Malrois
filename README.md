- 👋 Hi, I’m @Malrois
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend developing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web developing from the begginning, because I left industry for 3 years and forgot almost everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me reach my goals of becoming better developer
- 📫 How to reach me @Malrois on Telegram or Github
- 😄 Pronouns: however anyone would like to
- ⚡ Fun fact: when I study and get information by text or video format it make me want to fall asleep really fast, but when I study by practice (coding) then I often get caught by progress and lose track of time, so looks like I'm more of a practice person rather than theory person
